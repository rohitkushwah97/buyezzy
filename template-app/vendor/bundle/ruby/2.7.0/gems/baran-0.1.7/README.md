Text Splitter for Large Language Model datasets.

To avoid token constraints and improve the accuracy of vector search in the Large Language Model, it is necessary to divide the document. This gem supports splitting the text in the specified manner.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add baran

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install baran

## Usage

### Default Paramters

- `chunk_size`: 1024 (characters)
- `chunk_overlap`: 64 (characters)

### Character Text Splitter

Splitting by the specified character.

```ruby
splitter = Baran::CharacterTextSplitter.new(
    chunk_size: 1024,
    chunk_overlap: 64,
    separator: "\n\n"
)
splitter.chunks(text)
# => [{ cursor: 0, text: "..." }, ...]
```

### Recursive Character Text Splitter

Splitting by the specified characters recursively.

```ruby
splitter = Baran::RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.new(
    separators: ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
)
splitter.chunks(text)
# => [{ cursor: 0, text: "..." }, ...]
```

### Markdown Text Splitter

Splitting by the Markdown descriptions.

```ruby
splitter = Baran::MarkdownSplitter.new
splitter.chunks(markdown)
# => [{ cursor: 0, text: "..." }, ...]
```

Split with the following priority.

```ruby
[
    "\n# ", # h1
    "\n## ", # h2
    "\n### ", # h3
    "\n#### ", # h4
    "\n##### ", # h5
    "\n###### ", # h6
    "```\n\n", # code block
    "\n\n***\n\n", # horizontal rule
    "\n\n---\n\n", # horizontal rule
    "\n\n___\n\n", # horizontal rule
    "\n\n", # new line
