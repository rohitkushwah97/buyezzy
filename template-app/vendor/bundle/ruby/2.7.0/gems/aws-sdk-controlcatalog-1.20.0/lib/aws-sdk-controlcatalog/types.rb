    # If you are applying controls through an Amazon Web Services Control
    # Tower landing zone environment, remember that the values returned in
    # the `RegionConfiguration` API operation are not related to the
    # governed Regions in your landing zone. For example, if you are
    # governing Regions `A`,`B`,and `C` while the control is available in
    # Regions `A`, `B`, C`,` and `D`, you'd see a response with
    # `DeployableRegions` of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` for a control with
    # `REGIONAL` scope, even though you may not intend to deploy the control
    # in Region `D`, because you do not govern it through your landing zone.

    # @!attribute [rw] scope
    #   The coverage of the control, if deployed. Scope is an enumerated
    #   type, with value `Regional`, or `Global`. A control with Global
    #   scope is effective in all Amazon Web Services Regions, regardless of
    #   the Region from which it is enabled, or to which it is deployed. A
    #   control implemented by an SCP is usually Global in scope. A control
    #   with Regional scope has operations that are restricted specifically
    #   to the Region from which it is enabled and to which it is deployed.
    #   Controls implemented by Config rules and CloudFormation hooks
    #   usually are Regional in scope. Security Hub controls usually are
    #   Regional in scope.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] deployable_regions
